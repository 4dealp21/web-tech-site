## 1. Background

The aim of this project was to create a responsive website which attempts to solve a problem.
The website was designed for a music artist and it is a portfolio/presentation website named "VOXINUS".
A website is always important to musicians since it's always good to keep a presence online to promote the brand and in some cases to show some of the work produced.

## 2. Wire Frames

The project was developed to desktop first, and then tablet and mobile using @media queries.

## 3. Colour Choices

The theme chosen for this project was a minimalistic one because it is simple and doesn't get to confusing.
The color palette chosen for the website was a customer choice and it's based on red, black and white.
It matches perfectly with the majority of colors on images used in the website.

## 4. Accessibility

Since some people have disabilities, there are some rules that had to be followed to ensure that those people can use and understand the website. Using (alt) is important to support blind people by describing images, and that was applied in the HTML.

## 5. GDPR

GDPR was not used.

## 6. Distance Selling

Since the website was to a frined and it was not selled, the Distance Selling act and states were not needed.

## 7. Evaluation

Overall, the project was well developed despite having some strugles, specially when it came to the CSS positioning part and making the website responsive. The strong side of the work done was the color scheme and the navigation bar made with some JavaScript.
